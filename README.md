Introduction
============
`python-aprmd5` is a Python extension written in C that wraps the MD5 routines of
the Apache Portable Runtime (APR) Utility Library (`libaprutil`) and exposes them
to the Python interpreter as the module `aprmd5`. The main purpose of writing
`python-aprmd5` in the first place has been to expose the function
`apr_md5_encode()`, which generates salted crypt-style hashes using a version of
the MD5 hash algorithm that was modified especially for the APR project.

The resulting hashes always start with the prefix characters `$apr1$` in order
to distinguish them from the result of various other `crypt()` variants, which
use other prefixes. For instance, for input "foo" and salt "mYJd83wW",
`apr_md5_encode()` produces the following hash:

    $apr1$mYJd83wW$IO.6aK3G0d4mHxcImhPX50

Hashes like this are typically generated by the command line utility `htpasswd`,
which is part of the Apache HTTP server project. The hashes encrypt user
passwords that are used by the Apache HTTP server for basic user authentication.

For completeness sake, `python-aprmd5` exposes not only `apr_md5_encode()` but most
of the other functions of `libaprutil`'s MD5 routines as well. Where those
functions are concerned with the original, unmodified MD5 algorithm, this is
mostly a duplication of effort as that algorithm can be easily obtained through
the Python Standard Library module `hashlib`. In fact I advise against using
`python-aprmd5` if you are interested in the original MD5 algorithm only.


Release notes
=============
This is `python-aprmd5` 0.2.1.

Changes in this release:

* patch for setup.py by Juan A. Diaz to auto-detect Mac OS X and Debian
* the project has moved to GitHub
* no functional changes

For more details see the `ChangeLog` document.


Project status
==============
As of version 0.2, I consider `python-aprmd5` to be feature complete. Unless a
change in `libaprutil` breaks `python-aprmd5`, it is therefore rather unlikely that
there will ever be a version 0.3. Maintenance releases 0.2.x will occur only if
bugs are detected, or if I can be motivated to fix the crappy build process.


License and source code
=======================
`python-aprmd5` is licensed under the GNU General Public License (GPLv3). You
should have received a copy of the license along with the `python-aprmd5` module
distribution (see the file `COPYING` inside the distribution). If not, see
<http://www.gnu.org/licenses/>.

The source code for `python-aprmd5` can be downloaded from [GitHub](https://github.com/herzbube/python-aprmd5). The repository includes project files to hack `python-aprmd5` in Eclipse using [PyDev](http://pydev.org/).


Dependencies
============
Obviously, `python-aprmd5` depends on the presence of `libaprutil`. At compile time,
both the headers and the library file must be present. At runtime, the library
file is sufficient.


`libaprutil` versions
=====================
No formal tests for compatibility with certain versions of `libaprutil` have been
performed. The earliest version that I have casually used on my system at home
(a Mac OS X box) is `libaprutil` 0.9. Another version that I have used for casual
testing on a Debian virtual box is `libaprutil` 1.3.5. As the interface of the
MD5 routines has not changed for a long time, and even across major versions of
`libaprutil`, it is reasonable to expect that `python-aprmd5` will work with pretty
much all versions of `libaprutil`.

See the `INSTALL` document for details on how to build `python-aprmd5` against
different versions of `libaprutil`.


Python versions
===============
`python-aprmd5` implements both the 2.x and the 3.x versions of Python's C-API,
so in theory it should work with all versions of Python 2.x and 3.x. In
practice, no formal tests have been performed to verify this statement. The
earliest version of Python that I have used to build `python-aprmd5` with has been
2.5.1, and the latest version has been 3.1.1 (both on Mac OS X 10.5).


Limitations and known bugs
==========================
On some platforms, `password_validate()` incorrectly returns `True` if it is fed
with an empty hash, regardless of the password that is being validated. This is
probably a bug in the system's `crypt()` function, exposed by the way how
`libaprutil` calls that function. I have found this behaviour on Debian lenny, the
issue is reported [at the Debian bugtracker](http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=550360).


Examples
========
Example 1: Usage of `apr_md5_encode()`.

    from aprmd5 import md5_encode

    password = "foo"
    salt = "mYJd83wW"
    # result will be "$apr1$mYJd83wW$IO.6aK3G0d4mHxcImhPX50"
    result = md5_encode(password, salt)


Example 2: Usage of `password_validate()`.

    from aprmd5 import password_validate

    password = "foo"
    hash = "$apr1$mYJd83wW$IO.6aK3G0d4mHxcImhPX50"
    # result will be True
    result = password_validate(password, hash)


Example 3: Usage of regular MD5 algorithm. The example uses the `b""` notation
from Python 3.

    from aprmd5 import md5

    m1 = md5(b"foo")
    m2 = md5()
    m2.update(b"foo")
    # result1 and result2 will both be "acbd18db4cc2f85cedef654fccc4a4d8"
    result1 = m1.hexdigest()
    result2 = m2.hexdigest()

Installation instructions
=========================
The tar balls that can be downloaded under ["Releases" on the project page](https://github.com/herzbube/python-aprmd5/releases) have been created using the Distutils Python module. In the terminology of Distutils, the tar ball is a so-called "source distribution". Read the file INSTALL inside the tar ball for more details about how to build the project and use the resulting Python module.
